# realbook-companion

This small HTML5/Javascript app is the ideal realbook companion to rehearse or play alone on stage. Just put the files (images, mp3) and open the **index.html** file with a browser (Mozilla runs fine). All the content will be autogenerated by javascript. Use the on-screen semi-transparent buttons to select and control the music. You can even play rehearse loops.

## How to use the application

* Put **mp3** files inside the directory **aud/** --names are important, use [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) with the right extension--, e.g. **MyFavoriteSong.mp3**.
* Put **png** files inside the directory **img/** --names are important, use exactly the same name as the mp3 file; e.g. **MyFavoriteSong.png** --.
* Optionally, put **.mxt** (just plain text files) inside the directory **mxt/** to add your comments that will be displayed below the sheet; e.g. **MyFavoriteSong.mxt** .
The content should be similar to:

```
.
├── aud
│   ├── AChildIsBorn.mp3
│   ├── AfternoonInParis.mp3
│   ├── ...
│   └── Valentinology.mp3
├── img
│   ├── AChildIsBorn.png
│   ├── AfternoonInParis.png
│   ├── ...
│   └── Valentinology.png
├── mxt
│   ├── AChildIsBorn.mxt
│   ├── AfternoonInParis.mxt
│   ├── ...
│   └── Valentinology.mxt
├── lib
├── amx
├── ico
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── index.html
├── song.html
└── song.list <-- This is the main page content 
```
* List all your song names inside the **songs.list** file. Comments begin with the symbol **#**; all the names should be identic (mp3, mxt, png, titles), including caps. For example, to add a song, the names should be exactly like "MyFavoriteSong.mp3" (inside the **aud** folder), "MyFavoriteSong.png" (inside the **img** folder); **songs.list** should have an entry named just "MyFavoriteSong".

### Example of **songs.list**

```
# Slow
AChildIsBorn
AutumnLeaves
AloneTogether
BeautifulLove
# Standards
AfternoonInParis
...
Valentinology
```
* Copy the full directory to the tablet and open the **index.html** file with a browser. 
* Browsers use URLs like **file:///storage/sdcard0/Download/realbook-companion/index.html** .

It will look like this (depending on the songs you load, you can load a million, up to yout tablet's RAM memory):
